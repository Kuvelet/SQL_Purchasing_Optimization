### Project Overview
---
Given the numerous active vendor channels and rapidly fluctuating automotive part prices, it is essential to continuously monitor the latest pricing trends to maintain competitiveness. An SQL-based approach will be implemented to efficiently track, analyze, and update pricing data in real time. This solution will provide detailed analyses of pricing history for specific vendors, along with comprehensive price comparisons across all active vendors to optimize purchasing decisions. Additionally, we utilize MS Access to distribute insights, perform exploratory analyses, and effectively manage daily data requirements. Vendor names, part numbers, and pricing information have been anonymized to maintain confidentiality and protect proprietary data.
